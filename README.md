# eventd.js

JavaScript library used for developing applications based on (D)DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing.

The library focuses on providing some general guidelines for application components rather than
concrete implementations of different classes.

***eventd.js*** is written in TypeScript and compiled with ES6 target.

Usage in TypeScript projects is highly recommended since the library mostly provides TypeScript interfaces
for building different constructs.

# Instalation

Install the library using `npm install eventd.js`.
